# Advent of Code - 2022

This repository contains my solutions to problems within the Advent of Code Competition,
in 2022. I used Rust because this is the target language that I am currently learning.

## Organization

The repository is organized into subfolders for each day of the event. Contained within
each subfolder is a `src` directory, which contains the entry point `main.rs`. Within
each day's subdirectory are the simple example input data files as well as my individual
puzzle inputs.
